<br />
Info: PACS archive that provides high security and that is independent from the cloud provider. PACS Cloud is my master thesis project, still under developement.


<h4>
Dicoogle (an Open Source platform to share medical image)
<br />

</h4>

<br />
<br />
Info:

The Dicoogle is an Open Source PACS that replaces the traditional PACS database by an indexing and retrieving engine. 

The new paradigm introduced with the Dicoogle index engine is that it can potentiate queries over a set of distributed DICOM repositories, which are logically indexed as a single federated unit. To implement this and other DICOM services in a peers’ federation it is used a Peer-To-Peer (P2P) network.


<h4>Open Monitor
</h4>

<br />
<br />
Info:


Open Monitor is a project developed by Umit Project, and was started during Google Summer of Code 2011. Its goal is to provide real time data about internet censorship and restrictions world wide. This is a free service that runs on top of our free and open source software, and we’re working hard on it in the hope that it will be useful for people facing these issues anywhere in the world.


<h4>
Umit Project

</h4>

Umit Project is an open source international software organization in Computer Networking. The project was born in 2005 in Nmap's Organization and it became an independent organization in 2007. The aims of Umit Project is to make life easier for network administrators and for other users that want to be aware of what is happening in their networks.<br/>
Umit Project currently have two main concerns in Networking: Network Scanning and Packets Manipulation/Sniffing. Umit's Network Scanner is a graphical interface that offers network mapping capabilities, discovering of hosts, services and track changes in the network. It is also valid for Bluetooth Network Devices.<br />
At the other hand, the Packet Manipulation/Sniffing have other goals: create protocols, packets, send packets, sniffing, protocol testing, help on network software development tests, and other very cool features available throught a backend library and a nice frontend.
Umit Project has being supported by Google Summer of Code since 2005, and never failed a participation until this year. Umit Network Scanner has even appeared in The Bourne Ultimate movie, helping the CIA to crack into a journalist's account to find out where was he going to.
