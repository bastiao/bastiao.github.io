 "Creating medically-driven integrative bioinformatics applications focused on oncology, CNS disorders and their comorbidities"
</p>

		<p>
			Progress in biomedical research and healthcare requires profiting from the huge amount of data and knowledge that are generated. However, most of the potential users have no means to efficiently exploit this wealth of information. Up to now, many of the efforts done for developing bioinformatics methods and applications have not produced the expected societal impact for different reasons, including: 1) the deficit of integrative approaches that effectively combine different types of data from different sources; and 2) the lack of active involvement of the potential users (from experimental scientists to healthcare professionals) in the process of creating applications that mine, integrate, analyse and display biomedical information in a way that is immediately understandable and useful ('actionable') by the end users.

		The EMIF project aims to develop a common information framework of patient-level data that will link up and facilitate access to diverse medical and research data sources, opening up new avenues of research for scientists. To provide a focus and guidance for the development of the framework, the project will focus initially on questions relating to obesity and Alzheimer’s disease.
		</p>
		<p>
		I have been in charge of developing the EMIF Catalogue which is an on-going work of the IMI-funded research project EMIF (European Medical Information Framework).
		The main idea of Catalogue will be aggregate summarized data from disperse databases.
		Furthermore, I'm working in integration of this component with other components of the EMIF Platform.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another tool, that I have been involved is "Taska", is a collaborative and
			easily extendable workflow-oriented system designed to manage processes of data extraction and data handling.

<h4>Monitoring DICOM devices</h4>

		Picture Archive and Communication System (PACS) is a globally adopted concept and plays a fundamental role in patient care flow within healthcare institutions. However, the deployment of medical imaging repositories over multiple sites still brings several practical challenges namely related to operation and management (O&M). This paper describes a Web-based centralized console that provides remote monitoring, testing, and management over multiple geo-distributed PACS. The system allows the PACS administrator to define any kind of service or operation, reducing the need for local technicians and providing a 24/7 monitoring solution.

To assure strong access control and data privacy this solution is supported by a robust authentication mechanism and all exchanged data is ciphered and compressed before transmission.

<p>Thesis abstract:	</p>
		<p>

 Healthcare institutions resort largely, nowadays, to telemedicine in order to support collaborative environments. In the medical imaging area, the huge amount of medical volume data has increased over the past few years, requiring high-performance infrastructures to provide services with required quality. Computing devices and Internet access are now available anywhere and at anytime, creating new opportunities to share and use online resources. A tremendous amount of ubiquitous computational power and an unprecedented number of Internet resources and services are used every day as a normal commodity. This thesis presents a telemedicine service platform over the Cloud that allows applications to store information and to communicate easier, using any Internet cloud provider. With this platform, developers do not concern where the resources will be deployed and the applications will not be restricted to a specific cloud vendor. Two tele-imagiologic applications were developed along with this platform: a medical imaging repository and an inter-institutional communications infrastructure. Lastly, the architecture developed is generic and flexible to expand to other application areas and cloud services.

		The Dicoogle is an Open Source PACS that replaces the traditional PACS database by an indexing and retrieving engine.
</p><p>
		The new paradigm introduced with the Dicoogle index engine is that it can potentiate queries over a set of distributed DICOM repositories, which are logically indexed as a single federated unit. To implement this and other DICOM services in a peers’ federation it is used a Peer-To-Peer (P2P) network.

Open Monitor is a project developed by Umit Project, and was started during Google Summer of Code 2011. Its goal is to provide real time data about internet censorship and restrictions world wide. This is a free service that runs on top of our free and open source software, and we’re working hard on it in the hope that it will be useful for people facing these issues anywhere in the world.

Umit Project is an open source international software organization in Computer Networking. The project was born in 2005 in Nmap's Organization and it became an independent organization in 2007. The aims of Umit Project is to make life easier for network administrators and for other users that want to be aware of what is happening in their networks.<br/>
Umit Project currently have two main concerns in Networking: Network Scanning and Packets Manipulation/Sniffing. Umit's Network Scanner is a graphical interface that offers network mapping capabilities, discovering of hosts, services and track changes in the network. It is also valid for Bluetooth Network Devices.<br />
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="img/logos/HostDiscovery.png"/>
		<img src="img/logos/scan3.png"/>
</p>
At the other hand, the Packet Manipulation/Sniffing have other goals: create protocols, packets, send packets, sniffing, protocol testing, help on network software development tests, and other very cool features available throught a backend library and a nice frontend.
Umit Project has being supported by Google Summer of Code since 2005, and never failed a participation until this year. Umit Network Scanner has even appeared in The Bourne Ultimate movie, helping the CIA to crack into a journalist's account to find out where was he going to.

<h4>JDBQueue - Java Persistence Queue</h4>
<div class="row ">
	<div class="col-lg-3">

	<div class="col-lg-9">
		The basic idea of JDBQueue is to have a persistence Queue. Then, if the program need to restart, the queue is restored. We use a database because serialize a Queue objet is not faster, for each insertion.

This messages in the queue has 2 states:
<ul>
<li>PENDING: It waits for a worker poll the message.</li>
<li>PROGRESS: A worker is trying to work on the message.</li>
</ul>
There is a third-party state, that it is when the message are handled and it is completed. The work do completeTask and the message are removed from the DBQueue (persistence queue).
